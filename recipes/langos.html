        <h2> Description</h2>
        <p> A fried bread made from deep-frying a yeasty dough, 
            this Hungarian delight is then covered in a creamy garlic sauce and smothered in shredded cheese!
      <p>
        <h4>The Dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons instant dry yeast</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup milk, warm</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup water, warm</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4> For Frying</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 cups oil, approximately</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4> The Topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li> 2/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li> grated cheese</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <h4> Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> <em>Add the flour, salt, and sugar to a large mixing bowl. </em>
                Give everything a stir with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Now add the dry instant yeast and the warm (not hot!) milk.
            </li>
            <li> <em>Mix everything together </em> with the spiral dough hooks of your electric mixer while slowly adding in the warm (not hot!) water.
            </li>
            <li> Keep mixing until the dough forms a ball and does not stick to the side of the bowl anymore. 
                If the dough is very wet, add a little bit more flour. 
                If it is too dry and crumbly, add a little bit more water.
            </li>
            <li> Shape the dough into an even ball using your hands. 
                Then place it back into the bowl and cover the bowl with a dishtowel or lid. 
                Place the covered bowl in a warm spot without a draft in your home and let the dough rise for approximately 60 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the meantime, prepare the toppings. 
                For that, add the sour cream to a small bowl. 
                Peel approximately 2 large garlic cloves or 3 smaller ones. 
                Crush them into the sour cream using a garlic press and mix them in with a spoon. 
                If you do not have a garlic press, you can also crush them with a fork. 
                Also, grate the cheese and place it in a small bowl as well. 
                Cover the bowls with a lid or cling film and place them into the fridge until you need them later.
            </li>
            <li>Once the 60 minutes are up and the dough has significantly increased in size, sprinkle a little bit of flour onto your countertop. Briefly knead the dough, then rip or cut it into 6 pieces of equal size. Form these pieces into flat, round disks using your hands. The outsides can be slightly thicker than the middle part  but that is not a requirement. 
                If it is difficult to form the dough, cover your hands in a little bit of oil.</li>
            <li> Heat approximately 2 cups of oil in a wide pot. Test if the oil is hot enough by placing a wooden spoon into the pot. 
                If there are small bubbles forming around the spoon, you know that the oil is hot enough.</li>
            <li> Place some of the pieces of dough into the hot oil and fry them on medium-low heat for around 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Then flip them over and fry the other side for the same amount of time. You’ll notice that the dough will expand quite a bit in the hot oil so do not add too many Lángos at once to the pot, you want to give them enough space to fry freely in the oil.
            </li>
            <li> Once the Lángos is fried golden brown on both sides and fully cooked, remove it from the oil using a straining spoon. Place it onto a large plate lined with paper towels so that the excess oil can get soaked up. 
                Repeat these steps until you have fried all the pieces of dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread the warm Lángos with the sour cream, then sprinkle grated cheese on top and enjoy! </strong></li>

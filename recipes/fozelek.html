        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> The főzelék is a traditional Hungarian vegetable-based meal, 
            which plays a vital role in this cuisine as it complements meat dishes perfectly and has a good effect on metabolism. For many people, főzelék symbolizes childhood, 
            because it is a common method parents and grandparents use to endear vegetables to kids.
        </p>
        <p> Hungarian főzelék meals are frequently thickened with flour, 
            either in the form of traditional thickening 
            (rántás made with fat or habarás made with milk or sour cream)
             or simply by sprinkling some flour into the dish.
